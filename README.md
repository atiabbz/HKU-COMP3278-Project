> **Deadline: 11:59PM - 17 November, 2021**

## Project Description

You are invited to develop an **Intelligent Know Your Customer (iKYC)** system with **facial ID login function**.

## Further Information

- **Group**: 1-5 students as a group.
- **GUI**: Each group may design GUI based on the understanding of the above user requirement -- *Make your own design choice*.
- **Database**: Your database should have at least **five** tables.
  - Customer
  - Account
  - Transaction
  - linkCustomerAccount
  - linkAccountTransaction
  - *... Make your own table design choices*

## Development Tools
